Cloud Physics Project:
----------------------

It describes the motion of a droplet inside and outside a cloud until it reaches the ground, using a simplified approach.

It calculates:
1) the maximum height from the starting point
2) the maximum height from the ground
3) the time of ascent
4) the size of the droplet at maximum height
5) the time of descent
6) the size of the droplet at cloud base
7) the total time inside the cloud
8) the time of fall
9) the total time of rain process
10) the size of the droplet at ground
11) the difference between the raindrop at cloud base and the raindrop at ground
